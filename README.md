# AppiumEcommerce

Hello, this is my first attempt on Appium. It runs on Android apps called ecommerce (big thanks to the developer for creating this nice apps). Not the most robust, but hey, it works!.

Here are some details of the project:
- Appium version: 8.6
- Maven version: 4
- Selenium version: 4.9
- TestNg version: 7.9

For those who wants to pull and run it, keep in mind of these:
- Pull the project to local
- Run an android device
- Check on the emulator-name (run adb devices from command line)
- Make changes on baseClass and config.properties
- Run it from test class or testNg.xml
